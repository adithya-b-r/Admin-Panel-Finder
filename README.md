# 🛡️ Admin Panel Finder

A Python script that checks for the existence of admin panels on websites using user-defined paths. The script leverages threading for efficient URL checking and randomizes user agents to mimic real browser requests.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-threaded**: 🧵 Speeds up the process by using multiple threads to check URLs concurrently.
- **Random User Agents**: 🕵️‍♂️ Utilizes the `fake_useragent` library to generate random User-Agent strings for each request.
- **Color-coded Output**: 🎨 Provides clear visual feedback in the terminal with color-coded responses.

## 📋 Requirements

- `requests`
- `fake_useragent`
